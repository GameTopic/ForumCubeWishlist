# XFRM-Wishlist

Do you want to your customer or your user that could keep track your resources? Or Do you want your products be stand-out? If you ever think that, we support you with this add-on.
This add-on is aimed to create a wishlist for each of shopping people as they wish. By doing this, the resources might be desired for a long time. Other users could sense the temptation of that resource and buy it if they want. It is an amazing tool to stimulate sales and advertising on your site.
As an administrator, you could adjust the wish list of users and follow it to research about the market need.
As a user, to use the Wishlist functionality, simply sign into your account, and add items to Wishlist as you shop. Your resources will be saved under your account to review at any time. When you are ready to purchase the items on your Wishlist, view your Wishlist and then select press Purchase to buy it.
